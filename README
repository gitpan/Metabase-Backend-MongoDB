NAME
    Metabase::Backend::MongoDB - Metabase backend implemented using MongoDB

VERSION
    version 1.000

SYNOPSIS
      use Metabase::Index::MongoDB;

      Metabase::Index::MongoDB->new(
        host    => 'mongodb://localhost:27017',
        db_name => 'my_metabase',
      );

      use Metabase::Archive::MongoDB;

      Metabase::Archive::MongoDB->new(
        host    => 'mongodb://localhost:27017',
        db_name => 'my_metabase',
      );

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides a backend for Metabase using MongoDB. There
    are two modules included, Metabase::Index::MongoDB and
    Metabase::Archive::MongoDB. They can be used separately or together (see
    Metabase::Librarian for details).

    The Metabase::Backend::MongoDB module is a Moose::Role that provides
    common attributes and private helpers and is not intended to be used
    directly.

    Common attributes are described further below.

ATTRIBUTES
  host
    A MongoDB connection string. Defaults to 'mongodb://localhost:27017'.

  db_name
    A database name. Defaults to 'metabase'. To avoid collision with other
    Metabase data on the same MongoDB server, users should always explicitly
    set this to a unique name for a given Metabase installation.

  collection_name
    A collection name for the archive or table. Defaults to 'metabase_index'
    or 'metabase_archive'. As long as the "db_name" is unique, these
    defaults should be safe to use for most purposes.

  username
    A username for MongoDB authentication. By default, no username is used.

  password
    A password for MongoDB authentication. By default, no password is used.

METHODS
  connection
    This returns the MongoDB::Connection object that is created when the
    object is instantiated.

  coll
    This returns the MongoDB::Collection object containing the index or
    archive data.
